## ðŸ‘‰ Run project

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ArlissonC/authentication.api.git

# go to the project folder
$ cd Authentication

```

### Docker

In this application I used a Linux container, so I enforced a HTTPS. To do this we have to generate a trusted certificate.
**Generate certificate for windows**

```powershell
> dotnet dev-certs https -ep %USERPROFILE%.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p password123

> dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

**Up Container**

```bash
$ /Authentication> docker-compose up
```

**Up Migrations**

```bash
$ /Authentication> cd /Authentication
$ dotnet ef database update
```

**Running on: https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html**
